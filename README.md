This repository contains the **core framework of the Sulu content management system**. The framework implements the functionality that is built into the Sulu content management system and therefore is a dependency of all Sulu projects.

If you want to **start a new Sulu project**, you might be interested in the [sulu/skeleton](https://github.com/varunswarup0/tweet-stream/blob/master/package.json) template repository. If you are planning to **extend your existing Sulu project**, visit the [Sulu organization](https://github.com/sulu) on GitHub for a complete list of official Sulu bundles.

## üöÄ&nbsp; Installation and Documentation

The [tStream/package.json](https://github.com/varunswarup0/tweet-stream/blob/master/package.json) provides a **pre-configured project JSON template** to quick-start your development.
