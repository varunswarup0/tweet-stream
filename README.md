tStream is a highly extensible open-source **Redux-Thunk** application on the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework. tStream is developed to deliver robust **multi-lingual and multi-portal websites** while providing an **intuitive and extensible administration interface** to manage the full content lifecycle.

This repository contains the **core framework of the tStream content management system**. The Redux library implements the functionality that is built into the tStream content management system and therefore is a dependency of all tSream projects.
